## Prerequisites and Dependencies 

[***Caffe***](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/) - Training the model requires the *Caffe Deep Learning* framework. 
The *Recognizer Server* application requires the Python wrappers for *Caffe*. 

[***OpenCV***](http://opencv.org/) - The recognition server uses *OpenCV* for processing images. 

[***Dropbox***](http://dropbox.com) - You need to generate your own keys from *Dropbox* to access your remote folders.

[***DynamoDB***](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) - We want to move from *Dropbox* to some more scalable platform. We have done some initial work using a more scalable solution like *DynamoDB*.
